to be honest, there's not much going on here.

### CHANGELOG

__2/2023:__
- tweaked solar system start positions to improve first view (all in a line was weird)
- added some project links beyond the initial scroll window. now if people wander they can see some historical content that still makes me happy.

__1/2023:__ had a three day weekend and felt like switching things up. no real functional changes. removed some links that weren't being used.

__1/2018:__ only updating it right now because I'm applying to a masters program and there's a small chance they'll google me. :)
